## Executive Summary

The data shows that gross G&A of $17,688,177 (22.34% of revenue) is distributed across 785 entries spanning 9 expense categories and 17 departments. This gross footprint is characterized by concentration in three expense categories—Outsourced Services, Personnel, and Occupancy—which together represent 75.7% of gross G&A. Approximately 49.7% of gross G&A ($8.8M) is associated with expense categories that have high offset ratios (≥50%), while 38.5% ($6.8M) is associated with categories that have low offset ratios (<10%) and appear to represent persistent operating activity.

- The data shows that Corporate ($2.7M) and Legal ($0.8M) departments are associated with offset ratios below 2%.

### Structural Characteristics

- The data shows that expense categories characterized by high offset ratios (≥50%) represent 49.7% of gross G&A but only 14.4% of net G&A.

- The data shows that the top 5 department-category combinations (Occupancy:Occupancy, Benefits:Personnel, Corporate:Outsourced Services, Finance & Accounting:Outsourced Services, Legal:Outsourced Services) represent 58.6% of gross G&A.

### Entry Fragmentation Patterns

- The data shows that the five largest expense categories by gross spend are each characterized by more than 80 entries (classified as "fragmented").

- The data shows that the three smallest expense categories (Bonus, Marketing, Commissions) are characterized by 3-6 entries each (classified as "concentrated").

- The data shows that the Benefits department, despite being the third-largest by gross spend, is characterized by only 16 entries—indicating high concentration of spend in few transactions.
