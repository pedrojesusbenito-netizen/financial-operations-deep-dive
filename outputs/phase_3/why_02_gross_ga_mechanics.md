**Date**: 2026-01-06

---

## 1. Direct Answer

The data shows that gross G&A (positive entries only) totals $17,688,177, which represents 22.34% of revenue ($79,194,484). This gross amount is reduced by $8,429,793 in negative adjustments (-10.64% of revenue) to arrive at net G&A of $9,258,384 (11.69% of revenue).

The 22.34% gross G&A arises from concentration in three expense categories—Outsourced Services ($4.6M), Personnel ($4.5M), and Occupancy ($4.3M)—which together account for 75.7% of gross G&A. Similarly, three departments—Occupancy ($4.1M), Finance & Accounting ($3.1M), and Benefits ($3.1M)—account for 58.3% of gross G&A. The top 5 department-by-category combinations alone represent 58.6% of the gross total.
